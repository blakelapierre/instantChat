Jobs:

A job may be staffed by one or more persons. All jobs offer equal equity stake in the project. Do a job, have equity. Equity is worthless until we ship and make money (See `To Ship`).

* Chief Integration Officer - We need to be able to send our/your link out over every known text-based platform (think email, text message, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc., etc.). You, the CIO, will make this happen.

* Chief RTC Officer - We need to actually transfer files. Basically you just need to selectively take code from the facerace repo, or roll your own. You, the CRTCO, will make this happen.

* Chief Chief Officer - We need to do everything else necessary to ship. You, the CCO, will make this happen.

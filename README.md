Jobs:

A job may be staffed by one or more persons. All jobs offer equal equity stake in the project. Do a job, have equity. Equity is worthless until we ship and make money (See `To Ship`).

* Chief Interface Officer - We need to show users *what the software does/is doing*. You, the CIfO, make this happen.

* Chief Integration Officer - We need to be able to send links out over every known text-based platform (think email, text message, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc., etc.). You, the CIO, make this happen.

* Chief RTC Officer - We need to actually transfer files. Basically you just need to selectively take code from the facerace repo, or roll your own. You, the CRTCO, make this happen.

* Chief Chief Officer - We need to do everything else necessary to ship. You, the CCO, make this happen.


Apply yourself.
